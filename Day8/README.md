# Position Property
The position property is used to set the position of an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor. 
This property in CSS is used to control the positioning of an element on the page.

## Position Property Values:

### 1. **static(Default)**: 
This is the default value of the position property.

- Elements are positioned according to the normal document flow (i.e., they appear in the order they are written in the HTML).
- Top, Right, Bottom, and left properties do not apply to statically positioned elements.

### 2. **relative**: 
This value allows an element to be positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor.

- The element will still be in the normal document flow, but it can be offset from its normal position by setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties.

### 3. **absolute**: 
This value allows an element to be positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor.

- The element will be removed from the normal document flow, and it will be positioned relative to its
nearest positioned ancestor.

- The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to specify the position of the element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor.

### 4. **fixed**: 
This value allows an element to be positioned relative to the viewport.

- The element will be removed from the normal document flow, and it will be positioned relative to the
viewport.

- The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to specify the position of the element relative to the viewport.

### 5. **sticky**: 
This value allows an element to be positioned based on the user's scroll position 

- The element will be removed from the normal document flow, and it will be positioned relative to the
viewport.
- The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to specify the position of the element relative to the viewport.
